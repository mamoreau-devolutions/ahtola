# Ahtola ↔ Turso gap analysis

**Scope.** Exhaustive comparison of the Ahtola managed engine against the pinned
Turso Rust core — `turso-src/` submodule at tag **v0.7.2** (commit `046e9cbf6`) —
across all seven layers: **VDBE** (deep-dive priority), compilation/translate,
parser/dialect, built-in functions, storage/pager/WAL/b-tree, MVCC/transactions,
and sync/replication.

**Companion artifact.** [`turso-gap-inventory.json`](./turso-gap-inventory.json) —
the machine-readable inventory, with stable IDs for status tracking
(`open → closed`). This report is the human-readable analysis **as of analysis
time (171 entries)**; the JSON is the live tracking source of truth. Closure
progress since analysis (waves F1–F2.18) is recorded in
[section 11](#11-closure-progress-since-analysis), and current counts are:
**211 entries, 182+ closed**; expected-failures file down from **606 → 0**
lines after Phase 1 MVCC surface (`journal_mode=mvcc` + `BEGIN CONCURRENT` +
in-process `MvStore`). Remaining MVCC depth (row-version cursors, durable
logical log, checkpoint SM) is tracked in [`mvcc-port-contract.md`](mvcc-port-contract.md).

**Ground truth.** `src/Ahtola.Tests/Conformance/managed-sqltest-expected-failures.txt`
(606 failure lines at analysis time). Every line was cross-referenced to at least
one inventory entry: **606/606 mapped, 0 orphans, 297 explicit citations** (see
Appendix B for method). 84 of 171 entries have at least one mapped failure line; the
remaining 87 are source-evidence-only gaps (features with no executed
conformance coverage, e.g. virtual tables, sync engine, typed values).

## 1. Executive summary

Ahtola's port is **architecturally faithful but functionally narrower** than
Turso v0.7.2. The managed engine reproduces Turso's program model (register
machine, cursors, sorter, aggregates, compound selects, window buffers) with
deliberate opcode consolidation — 74 `VdbeOpcode` values against 204 Turso
`Insn` variants — and verified parity in the comparison/arithmetic/sorter cores.
The gaps concentrate in four areas:

1. **Planner/compiler depth** (compilation layer, 38 entries): no subquery
   flattening or decorrelation, no cost-based join ordering, no partial or
   expression indexes, single-table fast paths only. This is the largest
   functional deficit after DDL-by-treewalker.
2. **VDBE execution machinery** (35 entries): no trigger subprogram opcodes
   (`Program`/`Gosub`/`Return`), no virtual-table family, no hash-join/bloom
   family, no general ephemeral tables, seek/index-cursor families partial,
   write-time affinity enforcement (`TypeCheck`) scattered — the root cause of
   the largest wrong-values conformance cluster.
3. **Parser surface** (22 entries): dominated by one astonishingly cheap fix —
   the missing implicit (AS-less) column alias maps to **144 of 606** failure
   lines — plus PRAGMA family coverage, `INDEXED BY`, JOIN-of-subqueries, and
   assorted grammar forms.
4. **Upstream extensions not adopted** (policy, s4): typed values
   (arrays/structs/unions), `CREATE SEQUENCE`, materialized views, CDC, and the
   sync engine. These are product decisions, not defects.

Notably solid: storage format parity (WAL contract governed, 2 `parity` entries
closed), MVCC observable semantics (adapted, not reimplemented), the
sorter/spill path, and the window-buffer extension which is *ahead* of Turso
for the shapes it covers.

### Inventory at a glance

| Layer | Entries | missing | partial | divergent | extension | parity | Mapped fail-lines* |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| vdbe | 35 | 18 | 5 | 10 | 2 | 0 | 465 |
| compilation | 38 | 18 | 6 | 14 | 0 | 0 | 661 |
| parser | 22 | 17 | 1 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 320 |
| functions | 24 | 16 | 0 | 6 | 2 | 0 | 41 |
| storage | 20 | 7 | 9 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 32 |
| mvcc | 14 | 11 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 42 |
| sync | 18 | 11 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 |
| **total** | **171** | **98** | **25** | **39** | **7** | **2** | **606 distinct lines** |

\* Sum of expected-failure lines mapped to each layer's entries. Lines multi-map by design (one symptom can trace to several layers), so column sums exceed 606; the distinct-line total is exactly 606 (100% coverage).

| Severity | Count | | Effort | Count | | Status | Count |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | ---: |
| s1-correctness | 19 | | S | 63 | | open | 169 |
| s2-capability | 86 | | M | 71 | | closed | 2 |
| s3-perf | 34 | | L | 37 | | | |
| s4-intentional | 32 | | | | | | |


## 2. Method and classification model

**Sources.** Turso side: the read-only `turso-src/` submodule only (pinned at
v0.7.2, `046e9cbf6`) — `core/vdbe/insn.rs` (204 `Insn` variants), `execute.rs`
(~14k lines, per-opcode arms), `translate/`, `sqlite/parser`, `core/functions/`,
`core/storage/`, `core/mvcc/`, `sync/engine/`. Ahtola side: `src/Ahtola.Core`
(`Execution/`, `Compilation/`, `Parsing/`, `Storage/`), `src/Ahtola.Data`,
`src/Ahtola.Tests/Conformance/`. No upstream files were fetched ad hoc and
nothing under `turso-src/` was modified.

**Process.** Per-layer audits (VDBE done arm-by-arm; the other six layers in
parallel), each producing structured gap entries with dual citations. Then a
consolidation pass: dedup, stable ID assignment, repair of every citation
against the actual sources, and a full cross-reference of the 606-line
expected-failures file via a rule engine (~150 prefix/symptom rules with
word-boundary matching; multi-mapping by design). Every entry's
`conformance_links` were verified to name real failure keys.

**Classification.**

| Field | Values | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | `missing` | No Ahtola counterpart exists |
| | `partial` | A subset is ported; the rest is missing |
| | `divergent` | Both exist; behavior or structure differs |
| | `extension` | Ahtola-only, no upstream counterpart |
| | `parity` | Audited and confirmed equivalent (status `closed`) |
| `severity` | `s1-correctness` | Can produce silently wrong results |
| | `s2-capability` | Blocks SQL surface / conformance cases |
| | `s3-perf` | Performance-only divergence |
| | `s4-intentional` | Documented product divergence (managed port, encryption, unadopted upstream extensions) |
| `effort` | `S` / `M` / `L` | Rough porting cost |
| `status` | `open` / `closed` | Flip when the gap lands; drop resolved keys from the expected-failures file in the same change |

**Reading the mapped-failure counts.** Each failure line maps to every entry
that plausibly causes it (a symptom can be parser-blocked *and* VDBE-blocked).
Counts therefore measure **blast radius**, not fix order, and column sums
exceed 606. Two very large counts are umbrellas over intentional design
(`vdbe-ddl-executed-by-treewalker`, 178; `compile-attach-same-file-not-supported`,
61) — they map DDL/ATTACH-shaped failures but are `s4-intentional`, so they are
excluded from the actionable ranking in §10.2.


## 3. VDBE deep dive

### 3.1 Scale and program model

Turso v0.7.2 declares **204 `Insn` variants** (`core/vdbe/insn.rs`, header
comment "~190" understates the current count); Ahtola's `VdbeOpcode` has **74
values (0–73)**. Name-matching would therefore grossly overstate the gap. The
real mapping, built variant-by-variant:

- **26 direct** — same opcode on both sides (`Rewind`, `Next`, `Column`,
  `AggStep`, `Sorter*`, `Function`, `ResultRow`, …).
- **40 consolidated** — several Turso opcodes folded into one Ahtola opcode
  with a sub-parameter: the 12 arithmetic opcodes into `Arithmetic` +
  `ArithmeticOperator` (`VdbeArithmetic.cs`); the 10 comparison/jump opcodes
  into `Compare` + `JumpIfNotTrue`; `Init`/`Null`/`Integer`/`Real`/`String8`/
  `Blob`/`Int64` into `LoadConstant`; `OffsetLimit` into `OffsetGate`/`LimitGate`.
- **10 divergent** — both sides have the construct but structure/semantics
  differ (`Halt`, `Transaction`, `NewRowid`, `Insert`, `Column`, `Sequence`,
  `Explain`, `Fk*`, …).
- **104 missing** — no Ahtola counterpart. **~46 of these are upstream
  extensions beyond SQLite** (17 typed-value opcodes, 8 `CREATE SEQUENCE`
  opcodes, 15 hash-join opcodes, 4 index-method opcodes, materialized views,
  CDC); ~58 are SQLite-core machinery (virtual tables, triggers/subprograms,
  index cursors, seek family, ephemeral tables, schema cookies, bloom filter,
  …).
- **24 bydesign** — intentionally absent: 11 DDL opcodes executed by Ahtola's
  AST tree-walker, coroutine opcodes replaced by .NET enumerators, record
  construction handled at the pager boundary, `Not`/`Concat`/`And`/`Or` in the
  shared expression evaluator.

Ahtola also carries **~32 extension opcodes** with no Turso counterpart,
grouped in `vdbe-ext-window-buffer-family` (7 window-buffer opcodes) and
`vdbe-ext-worktable-and-gate-families` (work-table, gate, distinct, filter,
projection, compound-result machinery).

### 3.2 Name collisions (read before any porting work)

Four pairs of **same-name/different-meaning** opcodes are landmines:

| Opcode | Turso meaning | Ahtola meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Filter` | Bloom-filter membership probe | Row predicate evaluation (WHERE push-down) |
| `Commit` | — (no such opcode; `AutoCommit`/`Transaction` cover it) | Cursor-write flush returning `LastInsertRowId` |
| `ResultRow` | Same (row yield) | Same — but maps semantically to Turso `Yield` |
| `Yield` | Coroutine row yield | Resumable-statement suspension (returns `Yielded`) |

### 3.3 Verified parity points

- **Comparison semantics**: `Compare` + `JumpIfNotTrue` reproduces SQLite's
  storage-class ordering, affinity-before-compare, collation application, and
  NULL tri-state for `Eq`/`Ne`/`Lt`/`Le`/`Gt`/`Ge`/`IsNull`/`NotNull`. Residual
  risk is the single-value `IsTrue` path (`vdbe-comparison-opcode-consolidation`).
- **Arithmetic**: all 12 operators with SQLite overflow-to-REAL promotion and
  integer division semantics (`VdbeArithmetic.cs`).
- **Sorter**: external sort with spill-to-disk k-way merge (`SorterSpill`) —
  Turso parity including the spill path.
- **Aggregates**: step/finalize split (`AggStep`/`AggFinalize`) with per-group
  register frames, plus Ahtola-only `AggReset`/`SameGroup`/`GroupKey` for
  sorted-group streaming.

### 3.4 The two s1-correctness findings

- **`vdbe-typecheck-on-write`** — Turso runs a `TypeCheck` opcode on every
  INSERT/UPDATE record that applies column affinity + CHECK of storage classes;
  Ahtola scatters affinity across write delegates and misses cases (31 mapped
  failure lines, 15 cited — the `values-clause`, `affinity2`, `storage`
  clusters). This is the largest *wrong-values* (not parse-error) cluster.
- **`vdbe-aggregate-overflow-semantics`** — `AggStep` accumulates sum/count in
  integer and promotes on overflow like SQLite; edge ordering of the promotion
  vs. the step callback is unverified against `execute.rs` — flagged s1 pending
  a dedicated conformance probe.

### 3.5 Structural findings

- **No subprogram machinery** (`BeginSubrtn`/`Gosub`/`Return`/`Program`) —
  Turso compiles triggers as sub-programs linked into the main program;
  Ahtola has no equivalent, so `CREATE TRIGGER` is tree-walked and DML-with-
  triggers semantics diverge (111 mapped lines; most are umbrella-mapped
  trigger/gencol DDL shapes).
- **DDL is executed by the AST tree-walker**, not by VDBE opcodes (11 opcodes
  skipped by design). Consequence: DDL inside transactions, schema-cookie
  bumps (`ParseSchema`/`ReadCookie`/`SetCookie` missing), and
  prepared-statement schema invalidation all behave differently from Turso.
- **Write path hides index machinery**: `IdxInsert`/`IdxDelete`/`IdxRowId` and
  the seek family (`SeekGE/GT/LE/LT`, `NoConflict`, `NotExists`) live inside
  write delegates rather than as opcodes — fine for correctness of simple
  DML, but it blocks index-cursor use in general query plans and makes flag
  semantics (`InsertFlags.REQUIRE_SEEK`, `UPDATE_ROWID_CHANGE`, `PREFER_UPDATE`)
  partial (`vdbe-insert-update-flag-semantics`).
- **FK enforcement is delegate-side** (`FkCounter`/`FkIfZero`/`FkCheck`
  divergent): deferred constraints, self-referential cascades, and
  statement-level rollback on FK violation are the risk areas (17 mapped).
- **Error model**: Turso threads `Halt` variants with error payloads through
  the program; Ahtola throws .NET exceptions mapped at the provider boundary —
  error *text* and *timing* differ (16 mapped).

## 4. Compilation / translate layer
The largest layer by entry count (38). Turso's `core/translate/` is a full
SQLite-class compiler: query flattening, subquery decorrelation, cost-based
join ordering, index selection incl. partial/expression/covering indexes,
push-down optimization, trigger/FK codegen. Ahtola's `Compilation/` is a set
of 17 statement builders plus DML/Select compilers that emit correct programs
for the shapes they accept — but the **optimization and rewrite layer is
almost entirely absent**, and several accept-shapes are narrower than the
parser allows.
Highest-impact entries:
- **`compile-select-alias-visibility`** (s1, 66 mapped): alias scoping rules in
  SELECT — Ahtola resolves result aliases in contexts SQLite forbids/orders
  differently (ORDER BY/GROUP BY/HAVING edge interactions), producing
  silently different result sets.
- **`compile-window-function-tie-break-ordering-diverges`** (s1, 54 mapped):
  window frame peer-group tie-breaking differs from SQLite's full-key
  comparison, affecting `rank`/`dense_rank`/`ntile` results on ties.
- **`compile-alter-rename-trigger-body-not-rebound`** (s1, 44 mapped): after
  `ALTER TABLE … RENAME`, trigger bodies referencing the old name are not
  re-bound — SQLite rewrites them. Wrong-object writes possible.
- **`compile-affinity-rules-diverge-in-subquery-and-compound-contexts`**
  (s1, 28 mapped): affinity propagation through subqueries and compound
  selects diverges — companion to `vdbe-typecheck-on-write`.
- **ATTACH family** (s2/s4, 65 + 61 mapped): attached-database cross-schema
  statements and same-file ATTACH are unsupported/limited — by design for the
  managed single-file model, but it gates a large DDL-test surface. Read-only
  main/temp base-table joins are supported from a connection-local snapshot.
- **Planner** (s3): no subquery flattening (63 mapped), no decorrelation
  (25), no join-order optimization, no ORDER BY elision from indexes (17),
  no partial (18) or expression (19) indexes.
- **CTE/DML shapes** (s2): recursive CTEs limited to a single term (27),
  no DML inside CTEs, materialization hints restricted (22).
- **`compile-reindex-statement`** (s2, S effort): REINDEX not compiled —
  a small, self-contained win.

## 5. Parser / dialect layer
22 entries — the smallest gap *per failure-line* ratio in the inventory, which
is another way of saying the parser is where conformance cases die first.
The distribution is wildly skewed by one entry:
- **`parser-implicit-column-alias`** (s2, **S effort, 144 mapped, 8 cited**):
  `ParseProjection` (`SqlParser.cs:1794-1819`) does not accept the AS-less
  column alias (`SELECT 1 a`), so any test file whose expected-output prologue
  or body uses that form fails with "Expected X. At SQL offset N". Hand-verified
  during citation repair to account for the large majority of the 144-line
  parse-error cluster. **This is the single best ROI in the entire inventory.**
- **`parser-pragma-family-coverage-gap`** (s2, 65 mapped): the PRAGMA family
  (`cache_size`, `journal_mode` variants, `synchronous`, `wal_checkpoint`,
  schema pragmas) is only partially parsed/executed.
- **Grammar forms** (s2, all S–M): `INDEXED BY` hints (13 mapped),
  bracket-quoted identifiers in DDL contexts, JOIN-of-subquery in UPDATE/DELETE
  FROM, `NOT` operand forms, `VALUES` in more statement positions, special
  literals.
- **Dialect policy** (s4): Turso-specific extensions (typed columns, sequences,
  materialized views) are intentionally unparsed.

## 6. Built-in functions layer
24 entries but only 41 mapped failure lines — the function surface is largely
present; the gaps are **missing upstream additions** (16 `missing`: recent
JSONB aggregates like `JSONB_GROUP_OBJECT`/`JSONB_ARRAY`, math functions,
vector/time helpers) and **type-coercion divergences** (6 `divergent`) rather
than absent subsystems.
- `func-char-coercion` / `func-math-result-type-divergence` (s2, S): result
  typing of `char()`, math functions (`sqrt` et al. returning REAL vs numeric)
  differs from SQLite's text/number coercion rules — small, well-scoped fixes.
- JSON/JSONB: the JSONB binary format and its aggregate functions are the main
  upstream-ahead area; plain JSON function set is near-complete.
- Two `extension` entries: Ahtola-only helpers with no upstream counterpart.

## 7. Storage / pager / WAL / b-tree layer
20 entries, 32 mapped lines, and the **only layer with closed parity entries**
(2 `parity`): the on-disk format is contract-governed by
`docs/wal-interoperability-contract.md` and verified byte-compatible —
database header, page layout, b-tree cells, overflow chains, WAL framing and
checksums all match. The open gaps are **behavioral, not format**:
- **Page cache**: no spill/eviction pressure path equivalent to Turso's
  cache management (s3); cache-size PRAGMAs are advisory.
- **Checkpoint modes**: `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE|RESTART|FULL|PASSIVE)` modes
  not all surfaced; the writer/checkpoint coordinator exists internally but
  the SQL-visible surface is missing (ties to `vdbe-checkpoint-opcode`).
- **Shared WAL coordination**: single-writer locking model is managed-lock
  based; multi-connection WAL read-snapshot coordination (`SqliteWalReadSnapshotCoordinator`)
  covers the local case; shared-memory WAL-index equivalent for cross-process
  is intentionally out of scope (s4).
- **Freelist / incremental vacuum**: freelist management is partial;
  incremental vacuum not implemented.
- One `extension` entry: page/WAL **encryption** is Ahtola-only.

## 8. MVCC / transactions layer
Turso implements a full MVCC layer (`core/mvcc/`: logical clock, version
cursors, yield points, logical log, checkpoint SM). **Phase 1 (2026-08-07)**
lands an in-process managed port under `src/Ahtola.Core/Mvcc/`
(`MvccClock`, `MvStore`, write-set WW conflicts) with SQL surface
`PRAGMA journal_mode=mvcc` and `BEGIN CONCURRENT`. See
[`mvcc-port-contract.md`](mvcc-port-contract.md). Classic path remains default
(§1.6 of the WAL contract). Not yet ported: row-version chains / dual cursors,
durable `db-log`, header version 255 persistence, checkpoint SM, GC.
The earlier behavioral gaps below are closed or reduced:
- **`mvcc-statement-level-rollback-on-constraint-violation`**: closed (F2.x).
- **Savepoint / cache_size**: closed.
- Conformance: **11 → 0** MVCC expected-failure markers.

## 9. Sync / replication & provider surface
18 entries, 1 mapped failure line — expected: the conformance suite exercises
the local engine, not replication. Turso's `sync/engine/` (logical
replication, CDC capture, bootstrap/apply, conflict policy) has **no managed
counterpart**; Ahtola.Data instead provides the Hrana remote client and
optional-companion dispatch (`AhtolaNativeProvider`/`AhtolaReplicaProvider`/
`SqliteNativeProvider` load `Turso.Data.Native`/`Turso.Data.Sync` by name and
fail closed when absent — an intentional product decision, not a gap to
"fix" by renaming).
The 11 `missing` entries (sync engine core, bootstrap protocol, conflict
resolution, CDC capture — including `vdbe-cdc-opcode`'s `InitCdcVersion`) are
**upstream-ahead features**; adopting them is a roadmap decision (s4-adjacent
but filed as `missing`/s2 since they are unshipped rather than rejected).
2 `extension` entries cover Ahtola-only provider conveniences.

## 10. Top-impact ranking and suggested closure order

Ranked by mapped expected-failure lines (blast radius). **Rows shaded s4 are
design umbrellas** — they map many lines because whole test *files* take a
DDL/ATTACH shape, not because one fix wins them all; they are excluded from
the actionable waves below. Citations are hand-verified explicit links.

### 10.2 Suggested closure waves

Ordered by (severity → blast radius → effort). Each wave names the entries to
close and the expected conformance effect (lines that *stop* failing; a closed
line may still fail on the next gap in its chain — multi-mapped lines only
clear when **all** their blockers close).

**Wave 0 — quick wins (S effort, high yield).**
`parser-implicit-column-alias` (144 mapped — the single biggest parser gap),
`func-char-coercion`, `func-math-result-type-divergence`,
`parser-bracket-quoted-identifiers`, `parser-not-operator-operand-forms`,
`parser-indexed-by-hint`, `compile-reindex-statement`.
Expected effect: converts the 144-line parse-error cluster into downstream
results (many will then surface their *real* engine gaps — expect the cluster
to redistribute, not vanish).

**Wave 1 — s1 correctness (wrong results before missing features).**
`vdbe-typecheck-on-write` (31) → `compile-affinity-rules-diverge-in-subquery-and-compound-contexts` (28)
→ `compile-select-alias-visibility` (66) → `compile-window-function-tie-break-ordering-diverges` (54)
→ `compile-alter-rename-trigger-body-not-rebound` (44) → `compile-collation-propagation-through-subquery` (19)
→ `vdbe-aggregate-overflow-semantics` (verify + probe) → generated-column
determinism entries.
Rationale: these can return **silently wrong data**, which is worse than an
error. Closing `vdbe-typecheck-on-write` first unmasks the affinity-cluster
residuals.

**Wave 2 — VDBE structural machinery (capability unlocks).**
`vdbe-trigger-subprogram-machinery` (`Program`/`Gosub`/`Return`/`BeginSubrtn`),
`vdbe-halt-error-model`, `vdbe-seek-op-family-partial` + `vdbe-index-cursor-opcode-family`,
`vdbe-open-ephemeral`, `vdbe-schema-cookie-opcodes`, `vdbe-fk-enforcement-opcodes`,
`vdbe-checkpoint-opcode`, `vdbe-insert-update-flag-semantics`,
`vdbe-rowset-test` (OR-of-lookups), `mvcc-statement-level-rollback-on-constraint-violation`.

**Wave 3 — planner depth (perf + plan-shape conformance).**
`compile-no-subquery-flattening` (63) → `compile-scalar-subquery-not-decorrelated` (25)
→ join-order optimization → `compile-partial-index-support` (18) /
`compile-expression-index-support` (19) → `compile-no-order-by-elision-from-index` (17)
→ `vdbe-autoindex-for-joins` → `vdbe-bloom-filter-opcodes` / `vdbe-hash-join-opcodes` (L, s3).

**Wave 4 — storage & transactions hardening.**
Page-cache spill/eviction, checkpoint-mode surface, freelist/incremental
vacuum, hot-journal↔WAL recovery coverage.

**Wave 5 — upstream-extension policy decisions (not porting bugs).**
Typed values (`vdbe-typed-value-opcode-family`, 17 opcodes), `CREATE SEQUENCE`
family (8), materialized views, CDC, virtual tables, sync engine. Each needs
an adopt/skip decision recorded by flipping the entry's `status`/`severity`
(s2 → s4-intentional) in the inventory.

## 11. Closure progress since analysis

The waves suggested in §10.2 began landing immediately after the analysis.
This section is the running log; the JSON inventory remains the source of
truth (entries are never deleted — an audit trail). Every closure followed the
same protocol: engine fix against `turso-src/` semantics → targeted
conformance cases → full managed lane (3755+ tests, green) → resolved keys
removed from `managed-sqltest-expected-failures.txt` → inventory entry flipped
`open → closed`.

**Totals.** 180 entries closed since analysis (182 including the 2 `parity`
entries closed at analysis time); the inventory grew 171 → **211** entries as
closure work surfaced adjacent gaps that were recorded rather than folded in;
the expected-failures file dropped **606 → 11** lines (595 cleared; lines
multi-map, so a cleared line may redistribute to the next blocker in its
chain rather than disappear). One deliberate extension was recorded:
`compile-ordered-aggregates-intentional-extension` (s4 — Ahtola keeps ordered
aggregates because the EF Core provider depends on them).

| **F2.36 — remaining inventory zero-open** | 2026-08-06 | Closed final 29 opens: engine surfaces delivered this branch (access-method score, OR union, covering labels, equijoin probe, btree redistribute, FK Program CASCADE/SET NULL, ATTACH supported slice) plus intentional classic-path / companion-not-shipped / unadopted-extension scope (MVCC×6, sync×10, vector, vtab×2, super-journal, CBO/FROM-order, hash-opcode family). Inventory **211 closed · 0 open**. Conformance expected-failures still 11 MVCC-mode markers (not greenwashed). | 11 → 11 |
| **F2.37 — twenty-five-source-gap parity batch** | 2026-08-09 | Closed 25 gaps found by a fresh v0.7.2 source comparison: five scalar aliases (`chr`, `if`, `strpos`, `char_length`, `character_length`); three type helpers (`boolean_to_int`, `int_to_boolean`, `validate_ipaddr`); seven pending-byte/freelist validation defects; six PRAGMA surfaces (`synchronous`, `locking_mode`, `auto_vacuum`, `data_sync_retry`, `function_list`, `module_list`); and four function/parser surfaces (`turso_version`, ordered-set `mode`, `percentile_cont`, `percentile_disc`). The synchronous/locking/auto-vacuum setters provide Turso-compatible SQL metadata surfaces only; pager fsync, persistent exclusive-lock, and pointer-map transition semantics remain outside this closure claim. | 11 → 11 |
| **F2.38 — fifty-source-gap parity batch** | 2026-08-09 | Closed exactly 50 independently testable gaps from fresh v0.7.2 audits. **Connection/SQL (20):** ordered `percentile_disc` type preservation, cumulative rank, direct-fraction evaluation, and `ALL` rejection; unsigned composite date modifiers; DISTINCT aggregate ORDER BY; four `function_list` metadata defects (arity rows, window-capable type, flags/determinism, registered callbacks); distinct nested INSERT-trigger chains; four per-schema PRAGMA states; two pooled cache resets plus database busy-timeout reset; attachment timeout inheritance; and file-backed-main `:memory:` attachment. **Compiled expressions (17):** `IS TRUE`, `IS FALSE`, `IS NOT TRUE`, `IS NOT FALSE`, `BETWEEN`, `NOT BETWEEN`, `IN`, `NOT IN`, `AND`, `OR`, unary `NOT`, concat, arbitrary simple `CASE`, `LIKE`, `NOT LIKE`, `GLOB`, and `NOT GLOB` (including LIKE ESCAPE coverage). **Storage (13):** empty-only schema format zero; write-version, read-version, text-encoding, and b-tree-type enum validation; exact fragmented-byte accounting and untracked-gap rejection; literal 64-KiB WAL headers and persisted-zero rejection; restart sequence wrap; restart salt/WAL-index propagation; impossible commit-frame rejection across write/recovery/read; and short/unsafe rollback-journal header rejection. Broader MVCC savepoint atomicity, physical synchronous/locking behavior, and pointer-map auto-vacuum remain outside this closure claim. | 11 → 11 |
| **F2.39 — next-50 transaction/schema remainder** | 2026-08-10 | Closed the remaining transaction/schema/ATTACH/MVCC items from the next-50 ledger (gaps 39–50). **MVCC write fidelity:** multi-row and trigger-body INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE mirror into `MvStore` via `ReportRowChange` (with concurrent rowid promotion); named SAVEPOINT / RELEASE / ROLLBACK TO watermarks on MVCC txs; `BEGIN CONCURRENT` scopes version-store mutations to **main only** (attached/temp writes rejected). **ATTACH layout:** fresh attachments inherit main page size and MVCC mode; initialized attachments reject page-size and journal-mode (MVCC vs WAL) mismatches; Turso-known URI options (`modeof`, `cache`, `immutable`, `vfs`, `cipher`, `hexkey`) accepted as no-ops. **REINDEX / EXPLAIN:** bare and collation REINDEX fan out temp→main→attached (Turso `collect_all_reindex_targets`) and reject under MVCC; EXPLAIN/EQP route attached schema-qualified inners. **Cap:** keep SQLite-default max 10 attachments (Turso unlimited left intentional). Residuals: full attach+MVCC multi-writer inheritance; multi-DB writes inside one classic transaction. | 11 → 11 |
| **F2.40 — zero remaining `kind: partial`** | 2026-08-10 | Cleared all **18** inventory entries still marked `kind: partial`. **Code residual closed:** `vdbe-insert-update-flag-semantics` — `SkipLastRowid` freezes `last_insert_rowid` on Commit; multi-row intermediate then final Insert updates it; `UpdateRowidChange` forces pre-mutation old-rowid read; `SkipAllChangeCounts` covered (Turso has no PreferUpdate bit). **Promoted partial→parity (delivered claim complete):** seek family + SEARCH emission, typecheck-on-write slice, short-record defaults, ORDER BY elision, ATTACH supported slice, CTE materialization, duplicate PK rejection, pragma equals-form, RAISE messages, freelist DML path, hot-journal single-DB recovery, cache_size/savepoint surface. **Reclassified intentional (not incomplete ports):** EXPLAIN dialect policy; Hrana v2-only remote client; sync pool replica awareness (companion-not-shipped); WAL-index SHM multi-conn roadmap; MVCC checkpoint lock guard N/A on classic Stage-0. Inventory now **0 partial · 53 parity · 211 closed · 0 open**. Deeper work still tracked only under other entries (btree rebalance, super-journal, multi-table covering, P7/sync). | 11 → 11 |
| **Ladder P0 — live WAL multi-engine** | 2026-03-26 | Main-file SHARED + `-shm` DMS / peer visibility for managed↔stock SQLite WAL on Windows/Linux; macOS host verification optional. Contract: `docs/wal-interoperability-contract.md`. | 11 → 11 |
| **Ladder P1 — MVCC SQL + checkpoint** | 2026-03-26 | Dual-cursor SELECT/DML under `BEGIN CONCURRENT`; logical log; checkpoint SM skeleton (`RunMvccCheckpoint`). Residuals: schema cookie polish, full per-page SM. Contract: `docs/mvcc-port-contract.md`. | 11 → 11 |
| **Ladder P2 — macOS physical** | 2026-03-26 | `fcntl` byte-range locks + mmap `-shm` on macOS; fail-closed elsewhere. Multi-engine claims on macOS still need host proof. | 11 → 11 |
| **Ladder P3 — stat1 join costs** | 2026-03-26 | `compile-no-cost-based-join-ordering` residual: sqlite_stat1 N drives two-table INNER nested-loop outer choice and N-way INNER equijoin hash-build left\|right; OUTER unchanged; full System-R DP still deferred. Tests: `PlannerStat1JoinCostTests`. | 11 → 11 |
| **Ladder P4 — VDBE DML/FK emission** | 2026-03-26 | P4-A/B Seek + OpenEphemeral; P4-C `DmlCompileOptions`/FkCheck epilogue, shared `VdbeTransactionContext`, FK-on INSERT/UPDATE compile routing (DELETE stays evaluator for parent actions). Tests: `VdbeDmlFkEmissionTests`. | 11 → 11 |
| **Ladder P5 — storage polish** | 2026-03-26 | P5-A interior single-child collapse merges into sibling interior (`CollapseSingleChildInterior`); leaf underfull merge/redistribute already landed. P5-B three-way multi-sibling balance deferred. P5-C dirty spill N/A (clean cache). P5-D auto_vacuum/incremental_vacuum no-op honesty tests. `storage-no-btree-balancing` notes updated. | 11 → 11 |
| **Ladder P6 — docs/inventory close-out** | 2026-03-26 | README Important limits reconciled (planner/stat1, MVCC dual-cursor+ckpt skeleton, P7 still out of scope). Inventory 211 closed · 0 open; ladder waves P0–P5 recorded. No P7 (vtab/FTS/sync/typed values/sequences) without product decision. | 11 → 11 |

Small gaps between wave boundaries (e.g. 344→348, 304→305) reflect keys
redistributed onto a newly-unmasked blocker within the same commit group.

**Current residual (honest, not scoreboard).** Inventory is **211 closed · 0 open**,
but “closed” includes intentional scope and closed-with-residual notes (e.g.
three-way b-tree balance deferred; full DP CBO deferred; MVCC per-page
checkpoint SM incomplete). Conformance expected-failures still hold MVCC-mode
markers that must not be greenwashed. Live product depth remaining outside this
ladder is **P7** (vtab/FTS/R-Tree, sync/CDC, typed values, sequences) — out of
scope until a separate product decision.

**Maintenance protocol.** When a gap closes: (1) flip `status` to `closed`,
(2) remove the resolved keys from
`src/Ahtola.Tests/Conformance/managed-sqltest-expected-failures.txt` in the
same change, (3) do not delete the entry — closed entries are the audit trail.

## Appendix B — Cross-reference method

The 606 non-comment lines of the expected-failures file were mapped with a
rule engine (~150 rules): file-prefix rules (e.g. `partial_idx` → partial-index
entries), symptom-keyword rules (e.g. `pragma`, `affinity`, `trigger`), and one
regex fallback (`rx:expected \w[^|]*at sql offset` →
`parser-implicit-column-alias`). Rules are additive — a line maps to **every**
matching entry — using a leading word-boundary match (`_` counts as a word
character). Validation at generation time: 606/606 lines mapped (0 orphans),
0 references to nonexistent entry IDs, 297/297 cited links resolve to real
failure keys. 87 entries have zero mapped lines (source-evidence-only gaps);
they are listed below for completeness — absence of mapped failures means
"not exercised by the current conformance corpus", not "not real".
